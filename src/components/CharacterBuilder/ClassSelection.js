      <h2>Step Two: Choose a class.</h2>
      <p>
        Every adventurer is a memeber of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocatoin, what special talents
        they posses, and the tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or
        engagin in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are{" "}
        <strong>class features</strong> - capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from
        members of other classes. You also gain a number of <strong>proficiencies</strong>: armor, weapons, skills,
        saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many fo the things your character can do
        particularly well , from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.
      </p>
      <p>Your classes features will be automatically added to your character summary at the end.</p>
