      <h2>Step Three: Determine Ability Scores</h2>
      <p>
        Much of what your character does in the game depends on their abilities: <strong>Strength</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Constitution</strong>, <strong>Intelligence</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and <strong>Charisma</strong>. The six abilities and their use in the game are
        described below.

        process is through rolling a number of six-sided dice, but there are other, less random choices as well. These
        are described below.
